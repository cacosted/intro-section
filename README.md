## Overview

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Stylus-lang](https://stylus-lang.com/)
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming convention

### What I learned

This challenge was great to put in practice CSS and JavaScript and how to handle responsive design with these two.

I set up a script on `package.json` to compile and watch the stylus files:
```js
"scripts": {
    "stylus": "stylus -w ./styles/main.styl -o ./public/css/main.css"
},
// ðŸ‘‡ Usage on terminal
// npm run stylus
```
To add icons on the `features` dropdown I used this cool trick:

```css
// With the list-style property you can change the default bullet point of unordered list with a custom image
&__item
    cursor: pointer     
    &--todo
      list-style: url('../images/icon-todo.svg')
```

The intended way of implementing the dropdown arrow, was to add one picture of two depending if is opened or not.
I found a better solution, use just one image and rotate it depending on the state.
```css
.turn-up
  transform: rotate(180deg)
```
```js
title.addEventListener('click', ({target}) => {
  const ulSibling = target.nextSibling.nextSibling
  arrowImg.classList.toggle('turn-up')
}
```

The most tricky part was to make work the navbar in both in mobile and on desktop, 
but with mobile-first workflow and some media queries the job was done.

```cs
// A cool thing about stylus is how clean it looks
@media (min-width: 800px)
  .navbar
    display: flex;
    align-items: center
    justify-content: start
    gap: 1em
    padding-inline: 2em
```
